# ManiacLauncher

*  A simple Sonic Mania launcher made in Visual Studio using Microsoft Forms.

* I spent countless times trying to write this in C/C++ and I couldn't get it to work so now I finally made it in C# using windows forms and somewhat expanded it from what it was originally supposed to be. (Aka: adding mod loader launch option lmao)

* Like I said this is just a simple project I wanted to make and that's all really :P
